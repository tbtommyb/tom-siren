# TomSiren

A simplified version of the [AudioLemon Dub Siren](http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device.php?id=712).

There will be some differences between the Max patch and the C++ version and almost certainly bugs.

The C++ version is built with Juce and compiles to a VST or Audio Unit. Use the Projucer to create an XCode project.
